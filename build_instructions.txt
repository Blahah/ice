Build instructions gd-ice

Pre-requisits:
Maven2

1. Download sources from svn:
    $ svn checkout http://gd-ice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ice gd-ice-build

1.1 I prefer to use git-svn to talk to the svn repo, as git lets me
keep specific settings relevant to the deploy environment. With git,
the commands are:

    $ git svn init http://gd-ice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ice gd-ice-build
    $ cd gd-ice-build
    $ git svn fetch
    $ git checkout -f 

1.2 Let's create a build branch that's separate from the svn.
    $ git checkout -b build

2. Now, edit the relavent config and settings files:
    src/main/java/hibernate.cfg.xml
    src/main/java/jbeir.properties
    src/main/resources/log4j.properties
    src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
    
2.1 Commit those changes to your local branch:
    $ git add -u
    $ git commit -m "build: productions settings"

3. Let maven know about jbeir specific libraries.  Run the commands found in
   pom.readme.txt

4. Build!
   $ cd gd-ice-build
   $ mvn package

5. Now you should have target/gd-ice-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war and
   target/gd-ice-1.0-SNAPSHOT. Deploy these to your webserver install.
   
6. Updating
6.1 If using svn, just svn update and hope / check that your local settings
    are not over written by new defaults or new options.
6.2 If using git:

    $ git svn fetch
    $ git svn rebase

    Git will tell you if your settings don't apply. Fix those conflicts
    and git add -u, git commit.
    For best results, instead of adding all the changes to a single git
    branch commit, commit each file change into individual commits, so
    they can be individually tracked.
