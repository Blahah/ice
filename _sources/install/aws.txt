Deploying ICE to AWS
====================

The process takes about an hour to complete. You'll need

-  An `Amazon Web Services (AWS) account <https://aws.amazon.com/>`__
-  An `SSL
   certificate <https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/comodo.aspx>`__

We've included a dummy SSL certificate that you can use while testing
out the intallation process. Note that using the dummy certificate will
allow anyone in the world to view all your ICE repository data, in which
case you might as well use the `public ICE
registry <https://public-registry.jbei.org/login>`__.

Start the application
---------------------

1. Start a new ICE application by clicking `this
   link <https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/?region=us-east-1#/newApplication?applicationName=jbei-ice&solutionStackName=Tomcat&sourceBundleUrl=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-6612266/ice-4.1.13.war&environmentType=LoadBalancing&tierName=WebServer&instanceType=t1.micro&withVpc=false&withRds=true&rdsDBEngine=postgres&rdsDBAllocatedStorage=5&rdsDBInstanceClass=db.t1.micro&rdsMultiAZDatabase=true&rdsDBDeletionPolicy=Snapshot>`__.
   This will create the application in Amazon's Eastern U.S. servers
   which are accessible worldwide. If you need your ICE instance to run
   in a particular geographic location, please let us know here
   `here <https://github.com/JBEI/ice/issues>`__.

2. Enter a unique name for your application—something like
   "[institution-name]-ice"—and then click **Review and Launch**.

3. On the **RDS Configuration** page, set **DB engine** to **postgres**.
   For the username, enter "tomcat", and then choose a secure password.
   Click **Next**.

   -  Note that you may need the username and password to recover your
      registry's database in case of a catastrophic failure. |image1|

4. Click **Launch** on the **Review** page. It will take 30 minutes to
   an hour for the application to fully launch. When it is done, you'll
   see a green checkmark on the page. |image2|

Configure the application
-------------------------

Before you can use the application you need to upload your SSL
certificate to AWS.

1.  Go to the **EC2** site via the **Services** menu at the top of the
    page. |image3|

2.  Click **Load Balancers** in the left-hand menu. |image4|

3.  Select your load balancer from the table and then click the
    **Listeners** tab in the pane that appears at the bottom of the page
    and then click the **Edit** button. |image5|

4.  In the **Edit listeners** modal window click **Add**.

    1. In the new row that appears, under **Load Balancer Protocol**, ch
       oose **HTTPS (Secure HTTP)**. Change the **Load Balancer Port**
       to 8443. |image6|
    2. Under **SSL Certificate** click **Change**. A **Select
       Certificate** modal window will pop up. For **Certificate Type**
       select **Upload a new SSL Certificate**.

       1. If you're using an SSL certificate that you bought, enter
          "server" for the certificate name. Otherwise enter "dummy".
          We'll assume that you're using a dummy certificate from here
          on out, but the instructions for setting up a real certificate
          are mostly the same.
       2. Paste your private key and public key certificate into the
          corresponding textboxes. Here is a `dummy private
          key <https://github.com/JBEI/ice/wiki/Dummy-SSL-private-key>`__
          and a `dummy public key
          certificate <https://github.com/JBEI/ice/wiki/Dummy-SSL-Public-Key-Certificate>`__.
       3. If you have an optional certificate chain, enter it as well.
       4. Click **Save**. |image7|

    3. Click **Save** again at the **Edit listeners** modal window, and
       when you see the success message, click **Close**. |image8|

5.  Now we need to tell the application to use the SSL certificate that
    we just uploaded. Go back to the **Elastic Beanstalk** site
    (Services > Elastic Beanstalk) and click on **Configuration** in the
    left-hand menu. |image9|

6.  Scroll down to the **Network Tier** section and click on the gear
    icon of the **Load Balancing** card. |image10|

7.  Change **Secure listener port** to 8443 and the **SSL Certificate
    ID** to the name of the certificate you uploaded. Click **Save**.
    |image11|

8.  Once Elastic Beanstalk is done updating the environment, we're ready
    to use the application.

9.  Click the link next to the name of your application and environment.
    It will look like "jbeiregistry-env.elasticbeanstalk.com". |image12|

10. Once you ignore the security warning (since you're using a dummy
    certificate), you should see the ICE login page. |image13|

11. Enter the default username, "Administrator", and password,
    "Administrator". Change the password once you login since anyone on
    the Internet can now access your ICE registry.

12. And you're done. |image14|
